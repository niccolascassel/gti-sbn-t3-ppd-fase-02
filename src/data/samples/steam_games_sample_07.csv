Follow your instincts. Use the assistant view to find objects that you can interact with or your objective. Narrative Ongoing cold war was about to end. Both sides declared that they would no longer continue pursuing the war effort. That night, everyone was on the streets. People were celebrating the end of the war. The entire city was like a party zone. One of our friends was throwing a party at his home. My wife Anna and I were going to meet at the metro station to join our friends later that night. Eh, what can I say. We were all happy. As it turns out, our happiness wouldn’t last long. And our hopes for peace would vanish with the majority of the people around us. Everything was lost in less than a second. An unknown energy weapon hit the city. No one knows the true extent of the damage caused by it, if it was contained to just one city, country, or the entire planet. Buildings and Infrastructure are left intact. Animals and plants are unharmed. However, people… Many of them just disappeared. Now, no one answers our radio transmissions. No one comes to our aid. Everyone just seems to be vanished. No one is around other than some hostile savages. After the attack so few of us survived and what little amount of people who were still alive and sane wasn’t enough to keep government and law enforcement agencies functioning. Now it is the survival of the fittest. People became little more than savages. Every new day brings new hardships but in the end we will endure, we will survive, whatever the cost.

A PC version of the app was requested by many users and this is the initial attempt at it. If things go well here, the PC version shall be supported much more and optimized for the best experience. 🔸 Try out different sailing vessels to see how they behave 🔸 Learn different parts of a sailboat and what they do 🔸 Learn sailing through simple yet instructive courses 🔸 Check out different symbols, terminology and sailing equipment 🔸 Use sailing instructor guidelines as you practice or complete courses 🔸 Have fun if learning is not your thing by exploring or competing ⚫ Currently available vessels are ◼ Laser - Olympic ◼ Catalina 22 - Classic (Fin Keel) ⚫ Current Sailing Features ◼ Keel Control ◼ Keel vs Vessel velocity &amp; mass effect ◼ Boom Direction ◼ Boom Jibe &amp; Tack forces ◼ Boom Vang Control ◼ Main Sail Folding &amp; Unfolding ◼ Jib Folding &amp; Unfolding ◼ Jib Sheet tension &amp; Winch Control ◼ Rudder vs Velocity control ◼ Rudder &amp; Turning circle based on vessel mass ◼ Rudder reverse control ◼ Outboard engine control ◼ Outboard engine prop walk effect ◼ Drift effect vs Sail direction ◼ Vessel Heel &amp; Potential Capsize effects ◼ Jib and Main Sail 'Rudder Pull' when used separately ◼ Wind dynamics based on vessel velocity and direction ◼ Much more... As a Live-Aboard I wanted to create something anyone could use for learning as well as for those rainy days when going out to sea is difficult but you still want to sail. The sailing simulator was created to give an idea to those who are interested about the basic principles of sailing as well as to provide some knowledge in a fun and intuitive way. Although by no means this should be considered as an exact replication of the actual sailing process, it does provide things you shall encounter when you step on any boat. If learning is not your thing, it is very addictive to just play with a sailboat and physics applied to it when the wind is howling outside and you have nothing better to do. Some controls and reactions of the sailing vessels in this simulator have been set intentionally in an awkward way and not as a typical Sailing Game would do it. This is done to try and replicate what you shall encounter when controlling a sailboat by yourself. I have many ideas and additions I would like to make to this simulator so if you like its direction, spread the word as I develop it under way or in a marina whenever my batteries are charged from solar or the engine. ⭕ I try and upload updates every week with something new and interesting added to the sailing simulator. Make sure you update to the latest available version as i fix bugs and release fixes and new functions as i go. ✴ Please note that i designed the simulator with good graphics and physics in mind. Since i do not have the resources to check the simulator on older devices, if your device is older than 2 - 3 years, the simulator might not work. Unsupported older devices may manifest faults as broken texturing or in general the look of the simulator will not be as in the description screenshots. If your device doesn't support the simulator, try using a newer device or look into updating its Operating System. ✴ If you find faults (bugs) not related to graphics but based on general behavior, please don't hesitate to mention it and i should have it fixed in no time. I do try to check everything before i publish a new update but no one is perfect and things do tend to slip my mind from time to time.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2004650/header.jpg?t=1654695216","http://www.sailsim.app","https://www.sailsim.app/forum/","info@sailsim.app",True,False,False,0,"",0,2,3,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Demetris Rouslan Zavorotnitsienko","Demetris Rouslan Zavorotnitsienko","Single-player","Adventure,Casual,Simulation,Sports","Simulation,Sailing,Sports,Physics,Singleplayer,Education,Exploration,Sandbox,Choose Your Own Adventure,3D,Adventure,Casual,Realistic,Naval,Controller,Tutorial","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2004650/ss_d73abc9d730c48173bdbefa3cc75245d6e264c9a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654695216,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2004650/ss_271a96f21560e543c4c21ea73e6659b01abd5738.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654695216,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2004650/ss_9d06907311cc440d5a7a85f2ac7d34fcd84b313b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654695216,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2004650/ss_8b84b10f2057d11e2f9f7e06627071eb6fbe6270.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654695216,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2004650/ss_e1fa79c955c3d2b8307bc2957917eb6794b002d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654695216","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256887036/movie_max.mp4?t=1653227660"

The player will play as a mysterious swordsman and begin an epic adventure to unveil a conspiracy to overthrow an empire, and to take part in a deadly contest for a powerful ancient artifact. 1 Challenging combat Combat in game is mainly real-time sword fighting with a focus on immersion and realism. The player can dodge, parry, and unleash a deadly combo or use special attacks to quickly overpower the enemy, who are also capable of the same. Combat in this game relies heavily on player's fast reaction and strategy. Also worth noting, most of the combat animations are high quality, motion-captured. 2 The story The main plot is the contention that the forces of all sides revolve around a legendary treasure. With the ups and downs of the plot, the player may feel that the enemy is hiding behind him. Sometimes he can't distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys, and sometimes he is involved in plots and lies. Sometimes, he is touched by some sincere hearts. The protagonist is not a hero to save the world, but he dare to do what he thinks is right, not for fame and gain, nor for justice, nor for love, but for the beauty he has been searching for.","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/776600/header.jpg?t=1579660785","","https://indienova.com/g/witchsword","",True,False,False,0,"",0,25,12,"",0,0,"Witch Sword features fantasy blood and light violence.

While her parents set out to get her the treatment she needs, her determined older brother turns to the power of imagination to help them cope. While the outside world offers a harsh reality, these innocent children create a surreal fantasy world that gives them the play and comfort they need. Embark on a grand journey to five different lands filled with incredible robo-moose, floating baobabs, giant mushrooms, and clocks melting to the rhythm of passing time. In this magnificent land of make-believe, a cute little rabbit wants to nurse his ill friend the flower back to health in any way he can. He must use his wits to decipher puzzles inspired by classic point-and-clicks, uncover hidden objects, and play minigames to continue his adventure. Is it just child’s play or does it all have a deeper meaning that reflects reality? Take part in this inspiring story of siblings who support each other in difficult times through the power of imagination. Accompany them on the quest to help the flower regain its health. Travel through the wondrous lands of a colorful universe where you must question everything you know about reality. Help the rabbit solve puzzles, find hidden objects, and assemble strange machinery in a world where conventional logic doesn’t apply. Every step in the journey is accentuated by the atmospheric music created by the composer behind the scores for Layers of Fear, Kholat, Husk, and &gt;observer_. Listen to the song “Dreams” by Emi Evans, the artists behind NieR: Automata and Dark Souls. The song is now available for free on Bandcamp, Soundcloud and Youtube. Remember your childhood and see the world through young eyes again. Believe in the power of imagination: it always finds a way, even in the darkest of times. Your empathy and ingenuity can save the day.
