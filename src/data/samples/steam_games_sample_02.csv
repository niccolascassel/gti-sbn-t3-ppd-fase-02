839770,"Phoenix Point","Dec 3, 2020","200000 - 500000",542,0,24.99,7,"Phoenix Point is the acclaimed strategy game from the creator of X-COM, now with Steam Workshop support! The Earth has been overrun. A mutating, alien menace threatens the last remnants of mankind. Only the Phoenix Project, a secret organization of the best minds and bravest soldiers left on earth, can repel the invasion and reverse the inevitable. The Phoenix Project looks to you for leadership. Research and develop new technologies, explore a ravaged globe, build your bases, manage resources, and dominate the battlefield. Just remember: you're not alone out there. Factions, including the corporatist New Jericho, the indecisive Synedrion, and the fanatical Disciples of Anu, as well as a variety of offshoot subfactions, have their own values, goals, and view of the Pandorans. Work with these factions via Phoenix Point's diplomacy system, use subterfuge to steal what you need from them, or simply crush all around you with military might. No matter what you choose, victory won't be easy. Phoenix Point Features: Tons of Content: Over two years of updates, upgrades, fixes, and new content suggested by our community, including Steam Workshop support for subscribing and enabling mods, tweaking existing mods, and setting up your game the way you want to play. Try our example 'Custom Camapign' mod to set up new unique campaigns. Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced. Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Engage with a complex narrative, complete with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via several playthroughs. Explore, research, and discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself. Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them. Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass. Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Integrating the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']","“Elegant, atmospheric, and energetic, [Julian] Gollop’s latest remains remarkably hard to put down.” 8/10 – PCGamesN “If you like XCOM then you’re going to love Phoenix Point.” 9/10 – Trusted Reviews “Phoenix Point is, without a doubt, one of the best strategy games to come out in the last few years.” 9/10 – Noisy Pixel","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/header.jpg?t=1658422567","https://phoenixpoint.info/","https://phoenixpoint.info/support","support@snapshotgames.com",True,True,False,74,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/phoenix-point?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,3087,1188,"",47,3237,"Phoenix Point contains depictions of science-fiction combat, including the use of guns, energy weapons, explosives, melee weapons, and other military-style devices.

Be careful what you do or say for every choice will have some consequences in the future, for the past choices cannot be rewritten!

Great cheap price for something so enjoyable! ” 5 minutes of game: 'XWallpaper - это забавный и мощный движок для живых обоев, который отображает удивительные анимации и эффекты на ваших обоях с низкой загрузкой процессора.” (Translate: 'XWallpaper is a fun and powerful live wallpaper engine that displays amazing animations and effects on your low CPU wallpaper. ”) 爱の鉴赏家： ”推陈出新，她真的非常棒！初看到的时候我是有些不以为然的。因为动态壁纸领域，早有Wallpaper Engine作为领头老大哥，很多后起之秀，只不过都是模仿之作，而且其中大多数不过个赚个噱头，质量远远不如前者。可是当我实际用起这款软件，体验简直太棒了！如果非要说Wallpaper Engine有什么缺点，那就是能自由自在下到很多壁纸和壁纸素材，可是仅限于使用，玩家自己的可控性却很低。但是这个新秀，明显有意改善前辈的不足。她不仅仅可以对动态壁纸加入了大量的可控要素，甚至可以说将一些做图软件最实用的功能全都简化之后，再搬进来。在这款软件里，大佬固然可以大展身手，但是新丁也能够获得极佳的动态壁纸制作体验。另外，这款软件还主打一个新功能，就是支持鼠标的单独特效。正如软件介绍中写道：提供数百款漂浮粒子特效(200+)、滤镜特效(20+)、鼠标拖尾轨迹特效(200+)、鼠标点击交互特效(200+)，实则不虚。仅仅是简单的编辑，无论是壁纸还是鼠标点击，瞬间就酷炫了很多。如果想让你的桌面靓丽起来，如果想获得比Wallpaper Engine更好的自由度，这款XWallpaper或许能够成为你电脑桌面的超新星宠儿。“ 小熊饼干: '前所未有，真的，这个软件真的很厉害，Wallpaper Engine这个大家都知道，应该算是动态壁纸的标杆了，但对我来说它只是一个单纯提供别人制作的壁纸的软件，我很羡慕创意工坊里那些大神们制作的令人眼花缭乱的壁纸，美是很美，漂亮是漂亮，但缺少了某些东西，这些东西只有我自己懂，该如何做，当然是自己做一份满足自己的壁纸，但是，很难，对我来说太难了，我连业余都算不上，那些繁琐复杂的制作步骤让我望而却步。但是，xwallpaper能满足我 ，我相信，因为这种傻瓜式制作步骤简直是为我而生。 爱不释手啊爱不释手，轻便，对比Wallpaper Engine更低的cpu占用率，满足了对动态壁纸没有更高要求的人群，当然也满足了像我一样lj配置的爱好者，我不知道steam上还有没有其他的壁纸编辑软件，但这款，是真的打动了我。' 17173萤火虫： “一款UI精简清爽的动态壁纸软件，支持创意工坊，功能较丰富，玩家不仅能够找到适合自己的静态或动态壁纸，还可根据需要对图片进行单独的可视化设计，包括添加飘浮粒子，增加滤镜效果，甚至是改变鼠标的点击跟轨迹特效功能。既不占空间也不占内存，总的来说挺实用。。。。' 汉化语录: '《酷鱼动态壁纸》是最近由开发兼发行商XWidgetSoft发布的一款可编辑的动态桌面壁纸软件，使用者可以直接从软件的创意工坊查看动态壁纸的预览并下载，但它最大的优点是，使用者可以根据自己的喜好使用软件内置的各种视觉特效工具来把一张图片变成一个全新的动态壁纸，实现无穷多的可能性，并且产生的动态壁纸还可以直接上传到到创意工坊，软件在使用过程中CPU占用不多。。。' Blacklist_: “这是一款和《Wallpaper Engine》同类的桌面壁纸软件，不过内容上与ui都非常精简，支持创意工坊，壁纸的下载与更换都非常便捷，cpu的占用率也更加的低。但壁纸桌面预览功能个人感觉还不是很完善。 其次，还能够用基础图片自主设计自己的动态壁纸，并可以根据自己的喜好添加特效，鼠标指针的点击，运行轨迹等等也可以设计自己喜欢的特效，支持云，能够上传供其他用户下载。值得尝试的一个软件。”","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/header.jpg?t=1607489848","http://xdesktop.com","http://xdesktop.com","xdesktop@outlook.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,72,71,"",0,128,"",557,0,557,0,"XDesktop","XDesktop","Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Includes level editor","Animation & Modeling,Design & Illustration,Utilities","Utilities,Design & Illustration,Animation & Modeling","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_b1d3ea368506ed2b572b52a4cd621f9da8a4e15f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_025bb72d196d33192359941d50e193660e5a4905.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_fc75e7674c6504cd05ebc2e976c531d0ea7ecb41.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_63814f52104617fd5f68d16c4fd413c4b1b71879.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_7300607954b6ed31a34928f73819544f9cc4138d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_fb5b1c59896c570e5a8b71a4a24acfdd4dc620d2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_76d879d21a0f279274aec1fd01d5d64fcfe32e6b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_ba24ba3fcd7e17b09f271fa37a3d37aa52aece7f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_ef6f30cb676e63f06b3fd30bd3014833b5e8efec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_1b451cd8d843c95637e4247f7c7b980862cf7dd8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_56516ca22d95c97a99d7e047423842f8eee09ca9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256758665/movie_max.mp4?t=1565795573,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256758342/movie_max.mp4?t=1565100720,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256763932/movie_max.mp4?t=1570438319,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256763944/movie_max.mp4?t=1572261239,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760117/movie_max.mp4?t=1566747400,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256757970/movie_max.mp4?t=1567605898,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759660/movie_max.mp4?t=1566699139,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759351/movie_max.mp4?t=1566175333,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759081/movie_max.mp4?t=1565798208"

821880,"Idol Manager","Jul 26, 2021","100000 - 200000",102,0,19.99,0,"You take on the role of manager at a small (but growing!) talent agency. As you cultivate and train the newest generation of young pop stars , you'll have to decide who to hire and who to fire, who gets promoted when things go well and who gets reprimanded when things get sour. The personal lives of these young celebrities are a part of your business, and the life of a pop star isn't always a happy one. Their crowning personal achievements can be your greatest commercial successes, but their emotional meltdowns and PR nightmares can spell financial disaster for your company. It's not just the idols you have to worry about. The world is full of gossip magazines , super fans , and rival groups , all thirsty for a scoop on the latest scandal . There's a lot of people who want to tear you down and are willing to play dirty, but try not to let it get to you. It's not personal, it's business. Features Decide how to deal with crises including gossip, vandalism, stalkers, or threats directed at your agency and the pop idols you manage. Manage relationships between the different idols in your group, as you deal with cliques, internal feuds, and bullying. Grow your fanbase by varying your tactics and appealing to a wide variety of demographics. Produce singles , hold concerts, organize huge TV events and overseas tours to capitalize on your group's popularity and bring in revenue. Develop your agency's building . Start with simple offices and dance rooms to produce content and train your idols, and end with your own cafe and theater to create a steady stream of revenue. Hire and train staffers to help deal with logistics and keep your agency running smoothly. Discover substories - chains of events and visual novel segments, many of which are triggered by your play style. Each substory can play out in multiple different ways based on your decisions, often causing serious consequences for your playthrough.","['English', 'Japanese', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Portuguese - Brazil']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/821880/header.jpg?t=1652241767","https://idolmanager.net/","","support@playism.jp",True,True,True,73,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/idol-manager?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,2479,301,"",102,2533,"This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work.
