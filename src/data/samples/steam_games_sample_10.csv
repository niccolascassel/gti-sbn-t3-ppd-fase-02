Massacre and loot your way through this shifting woodland Nightmare, grow in power and improve your tactics, and maybe, if you can reach all six Carrion Shrines and slay every horrible thing that crawls out of the shadows to stop you, you might just make it back to life. You might even get your revenge. Just know that a wrong move will be your end. Again. For now. It's a harsh Nightmare. You know what they say—if at first you don't escape, die, die again.

MAIN FEATURES A Turn-Based, Hex-Grid, Strategic, Difficult, Horror Roguelike where death is one misstep away. Being turn-based doesn't mean the action is slow. Commands play out as quickly as you input them. Monsters come in packs, but take their turns all at once. Nonetheless, if you want to think about your actions carefully, you have all the time in the world. Death is very patient and a painful Reconstitution is just a click away. Scavenge, Survive, and Improve as you rip equipment, ammo, and hearts from the carcasses of your foes. You can find and wield 70 weapons, masks and items. You can also build your own Faceless and try different tactics utilizing over 40 perks.

1156200,"VirtuaLiron - Immersive YOGA practice","Nov 14, 2019","0 - 20000",0,0,3.99,0,"Welcome to our virtual yoga practice. The session we’ve built is suitable for everyone, both beginners and those already on the yoga path. During the practice we want to strengthen our attentiveness. We practice to the exact extent of our abilities at this moment, and from the principle of non-injury, or AHIMSA. During the practice we are attentive to our bodies, especially our breathing, it directs us. Practice is performed unhurriedly, quietly. Yoga is restraining the fluctuating consciousness, without tension and without strength. If during the VR session you experience dizziness, discomfort or pain, it’s always possible to stop and take off the headset. The session will stop automatically and will resume when the headset is put on again. The more we recruit our awareness during the session, the more the practice will be complete and deeper. The VirtuaLiron yoga practice package includes 3 sessions of different length. 30, 60 and 90 minutes. You can choose the form of the teacher from 3 different avatars: A female body avatar where subtle changes in the body colors indicate the breathing sequence. A muscle model avatar where you can see during the practice which muscles are exerting force, and a skeleton avatar that shows the bones structure, engulfed in a transparent body envelope. The teacher will always be in your field of view, regardless where your head is pointing to. This is a fundamental advantage over practice in the real world. You do not need to exit the posture or the flow of movement in order to see what the teacher is doing. While you practice, your head rotation also determines the angle you will see the teacher from.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1156200/header.jpg?t=1574172702","http://www.virtualliron.com","http://www.virtualliron.com","oevenzohar@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,0,2,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Oshri","Even Zohar","Single-player","Casual,Indie,Sports","Indie,Casual,Sports,VR","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1156200/ss_4e2db10b43205207b7cff6c9ddb1f5a2fb0f7c47.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574172702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1156200/ss_95981e8152fb03a5a686f85bda2462d96f1304e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574172702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1156200/ss_6212cc213ceada5640d124afbb95a44dffaa3342.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574172702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1156200/ss_34e0986367eb7cb21242b12b2520c565e68b22eb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574172702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1156200/ss_1e3b6b0dd033b510f04df9d6b7a32e5566306624.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574172702","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256767050/movie_max.mp4?t=1573555894"
