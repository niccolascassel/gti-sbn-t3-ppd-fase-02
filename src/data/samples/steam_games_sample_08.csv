Strike Suit Infinity is a frantic high score chaser where your skill is the only thing that matters. Whatever combat experience you have had so far is considered irrelevant. There is no end to the enemies you will face. There is no winning. There is only the fight for survival. Take to the cockpit of one of three Strike Suits, engaging waves of enemies, building your multiplier and putting as many points on the board as possible. You’ll need to use your head, though. In between rounds, use credits to purchase upgrades and reinforcements, maximizing your potential in the next round. The longer you can stay alive, the bigger your score, and the higher up the leaderboard you’ll find yourself. Engage intelligent enemy fighters and take on colossal capital ships, exploiting weak points in their super-structure to blow them apart piece by piece. Upgrade your Strike Suit and customize your weapon load-outs to tailor combat to your tastes. Take advantage of three very different Strike Suits to experience dogfighting action as you’ve never seen it before. Key Features Fast, frantic space combat: freely engage multiple enemies, dogfight other pilots and fight massive fleet battles. The Strike Suit: strategically switch from Pursuit Mode (speed and power) to Strike Mode (a powerful, highly maneuverable combat mode). It’s all about your score – build your multiplier, take down waves of enemy as fast as you can, and race to the top of the leaderboard. Manage your strategy – use credits in between rounds to purchase upgrades and reinforcements for the next round. Capital Ship Destruction: take capital ships apart piece by piece – take out their turrets and target weak-points to blow out entire sections of their superstructure. Ship Designs from renowned Mechanical Design engineer Junji Okubo (Appleseed: Ex Machina, Steel Battalion). Music from award-winning sound designer Paul Ruskay (Homeworld) including a collaboration with Japanese singer/songwriter Kokia (Tales of Innocence, Gunslinger Girl: II Teatrino) and Subsource.

The evil lord Cthulhu and his minions of darkness threaten the destruction of all life as we know it, it is up to your strategy and wits to stop him. Battle through 4 types of levels before having to face the final boss himself, outfitting yourself with more gear and upgraded characters after each successful fight. Careful planning, coordinate attacks, and unique abilities are crucial in deciding whether your team emerges victorious, or falls victim to the invading monsters. How to Play: 1) Determine Enemy Attacks: Choose which hero each enemy will be attacking for this combat sequence. 2) Determine Hero Attacks: Choose which heroes will attack which enemies. Will you gang up to take out the hardest hitting enemy, or target the enemy healer instead? 3) Use Hero Abilities: Heroes can use special abilities that greatly impact the battle. Some can attack an additional time, add critical strikes to their attacks, or heal allies! 4) Damage Phase: Heroes deal their attacks to enemies, and then enemies deal their attacks to heroes. This means you can target an enemy so he is killed before he is able to make a large attack! 5) Battle Again!: Enemies and players repeat the phases of combat again until all enemies or all heroes are dead. 6) Post Battle: Depending on the difficulty of the battle, medals are awarded to the player. The player can then spend these medals to upgrade their units with additional stats, healing potions, or more unique abilities! 7) After 4 rounds of fighting, the final boss appears... Lord Cthulhu. He is almost impossible to overcome, and will take an insane amount of planning and strategy to defeat. Think you are up for the task? Background: 8-Bit Attack was originally a boardgame created by Petersen Games that successfully launched on kickstarter to the tune of $40,000+ in funding. One of the stretch goals for the kickstarter was this video game, so here we are! This game follows the same rules, characters, and core gameplay, but modified to be more friendly to a PC audience. We hope you enjoy the wonderful battles, art, and design as much as we do.
