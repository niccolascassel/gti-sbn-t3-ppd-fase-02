1736590,"Shambled Spiral","Sep 14, 2021","0 - 20000",0,0,1.99,0,"This game has a relatively fast pace completion time. It's my first game put onto the store and for a cheap price too. I hope you can enjoy it for what it is. You are to go around in a spiral which has different scenarios/environments. Hence the name 'Shambled Spiral' Its design is in first person and you will be expected to acquire weapons off enemies or in allocated areas to progress. It is currently only singleplayer with 'possible' local hosting co-op in the future. I have implemented a couple of different image, sound and text triggers for a distinct immersion. The setting of the game is predominantly gloomy and medieval. There will be some difficulty, in a sense of slight puzzle solving. If you buy this version, you will have access to the new and improved version on the new and improved engine, when I can get around to do it. Don't expect anything crazy. All feedback is greatly appreciated. I wish for you to enjoy!

Unfortunately, your shady demolition business can't afford a wrecking ball so you'll have to use your car instead. Don't think you can go about your job as you please. Holdout shoppers are still in the mall, and dangerous mayhem is around every corner! The goal is to destroy as many things in the mall as possible. Getting stuck for more than a few seconds or hitting too many shoppers means game over. You won't go unrewarded for your efforts. For every object you destroy you will receive points. Points can be used to unlock abilities to greatly enhance the demolition experience. If you gain enough points in a certain mall you will unlock an ability! Abilities help you get unstuck, avoid shoppers, or destroy objects. Boost-Gain a quick burst of speed to blast through obstacles or get unstuck. Balls Of Steel-Magically drops down 4 huge steel balls from the sky, destroying everything in their path. Ghost-Fear those shoppers no more! Instead of running the shoppers over on 'accident', you'll pass right through them. Radial Force-It's like the force, but radial. Second Chance-Are you stuck? No problem! Just use this ability to spawn back at the center of the mall. This is the only ability that can only be used once per game. Give Up-Had enough? Use this ability to destroy your car and save the current score. Ready to up the challenge? Modes make the game harder to play. You can enable as many modes as you want. You'll be rewarded by a score multiplier while the mode is enabled. The amount of lives you have can also be adjusted to tweak the difficulty even more. Blackout-Power outage in the mall! With all of the lights out you'll have to rely only on your headlights. Slippery Floors-The janitor just recently mopped up the floors. The mall just turned into a drift course! Earthquake-Everything is starting to shake. Can you destroy the mall before the earthquake destroys you? Inversion-Everything will be flipped upside down. Gravity vector change not included. Deadly Walls-Let's just pretend that the walls are lava. Black Friday-The mall is packed today! Can you destroy the mall before the shoppers get their Black Friday deals? Fast paced action packed gameplay; there’s mayhem around every corner. Advanced destruction technology that fully utilizes Unreal Engine 4. Navigate through six huge malls packed with items. Action packed arcade style gameplay with six game modes. Steam achievements and Steam Cloud save support. Relaxing mall music and elevator music that goes perfectly with the destruction.

Roused from a life of sloth to reunite with his long-lost brother in search of unimaginable riches, reluctant hero Fester Mudd somehow manages to be intrepid but cowardly, ambitious yet lazy, dimwitted but brilliant. In Episode 1, Fester hits the trail to join his brother, Bud, in the downtrodden town of Loamsmouth. But when Bud is found to have mysteriously vanished, Fester realizes that the journey will be far longer and more treacherous than he bargained for...and he must enlist the aid of an experienced gunslinger to help him make his way through Indian territory to track down both his missing brother and the gold that awaits them both! But gunslingers don't come cheap...and Fester must find a way to convince him to join him on the perilous quest. This Episode sees Fester exploring Loamsmouth and surrounding territories. Along the way, he'll meet and deal with an assortment of Old West roughnecks, flim-flammers, and other larger-than-life characters...and give adventure game fans a huge blast from the past! IMPORTANT: The development of Fester Mudd games has been cancelled, and this episode is the only one available. Please note that it was designed to be part of a trilogy, and you will not experience the full story as the other two episodes won’t become available. The developer sincerely wishes to thank everyone who played and supported the journey of Fester Mudd.","['English', 'German']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/253310/header.jpg?t=1447358704","https://www.replaygamesinc.com/store/index/products/item/fester-mudd-curse-of-the-gold","https://www.replaygamesinc.com/index/contact-us","support@replaygamesinc.com",True,True,True,76,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fester-mudd-curse-of-the-gold---episode-1?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,0,0,"",15,0,"",0,0,0,0,"","","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Captions available","Adventure","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/253310/ss_5fff232d5f886e7c921b2677bf21b17b28848a32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447358704,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/253310/ss_65fe4191cd0d45974b70fc5f601b65d71e28b906.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447358704,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/253310/ss_96496433e2d53a01bd5c7308584c9df3ba723d75.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447358704,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/253310/ss_460228dc3ba681a648e5bdee61f3114199cbe6ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447358704,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/253310/ss_d2ae73b1cb71389b20f30612314419f5e57377f9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447358704,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/253310/ss_959656bc2f8eabf71e431ecb06b44775af537978.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447358704","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030071/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359478"
