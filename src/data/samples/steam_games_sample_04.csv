Here's what the same program looks like after a few speed upgrades: Unlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression. Programming is done in a simple language similar to python. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts that you need and is very beginner friendly by unlocking and explaining them one by one. If you already have programming experience you should be able to play through the early game very quickly and get to the more complex late game tasks that should still be a fun challenge even for experienced programmers.","['English']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2060160/header.jpg?t=1676049584","","","truffelbaguette@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,0,0,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Timon Herzog","Timon Herzog","Single-player","Casual,Indie,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2060160/ss_5206b0be81d8215d3dde934e94ae98f741919786.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676049584,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2060160/ss_fccb9f5feb8b75f0760a81d3b5bab9418239638a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676049584,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2060160/ss_cd739e2db8189aa61c0d6238300b387694a6fa07.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676049584,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2060160/ss_f5de7dfc6e9c840919cf4e67b056bec50628359f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676049584,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2060160/ss_fccb12fc637449e6c56f364d5cd47ed0a1944c2d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676049584","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256892528/movie_max.mp4?t=1663492594"

It explores themes such as the loss of control, fear of the dark, and the paranoia found within the unknown. After waking up in the middle of the night, your only desire is for a drink of water, and to go back to sleep. The game heavily emphasises exploration, with the ability to interact with various objects in the world. Originally released in 2019 on Itch, the Steam Edition of Seroutte is updated with a number of small fixes. This game is *very* short. You aren't going to get hours of gameplay from this. It was created by a solo developer in a short amount of time, with the aim to learn as much as possible from developing and releasing the game. Key Features Explore a familiar yet distant environment. Even our own homes can feel foreign to us in the dead of night. Exploring the house may give you some clues on what to do. Immerse yourself in the universal sense of unease. You are alone, in the dark, in the middle of the night. You've finally built up the courage to get out of bed, and get the drink of water you so desperately need, but your entire body is screaming at you to stay where it's safe. Future Updates Future plans include updated audio, achievements, translations, and various other features. Currently the game works on the Steam Deck though with some minor bugs, these will be fixed in coming updates.

2097730,"Nitrous Firetruck","Feb 9, 2023","0 - 20000",0,0,4.99,0,"Quick Overview Become part of the fire department that protects and serves both Lence City and Arkdale! Your job is to operate the lone fire engine that must respond to fire calls in both cities, which are 6 miles apart. But today is your lucky day because the cities have finally agreed to put together some funds to install Nitrous Oxide on the fire engine! However, with this new addition they now strictly track your response time and you must get to (and put out) the fires within 60 seconds of being dispatched. Key Features You will be driving a firetruck equipped with Nitrous Oxide which can be activated once every 10 seconds. However, this boost can be upgraded with money earned from successfully completing calls to last up to 10 seconds. There is a water cannon mounted above the mid section of the firetruck which can be controlled by parking the truck and pressing 'V', then using the arrow keys to point the cannon and extinguish the fire(s). The water pressure can be increased resulting in more water bullets being shot at a further distance, or pressure can be decreased which would result in less water bullets being shot at a shorter distance. The firetruck contains a 1000 gallon water tank (which actually holds large water bullets). The tank can currently be upgraded to hold 500 extra gallons and it can be refilled instantly when driving past a fire hydrant. This firetruck is equipped with heavy duty breaks which can be upgraded to be 10% more effective with each upgrade level, up to a maximum of 50% more effective. Trust me, you'll need these upgraded breaks when your boost makes you go from 0-90mph. Your final score is made up of how long you lasted, how many calls you completed and the difficulty of each call you had. You can also see your high score and try to beat it every time you start a shift! Early Access Notes I'd like to remind you that this game is being released as an early access game, meaning there are still a lot of ideas I have for it that I would like to implement in the coming weeks/months. I would also love to hear from the people playing this game, constructive criticism and suggestions are greatly appreciated and the easiest way to contact me would be through the discord linked on this page (bugs can also be reported in the discord).","['English']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2097730/header.jpg?t=1675960384","","","firecastlestudios@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,0,0,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"FireCastle Studios","FireCastle Studios","Single-player","Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2097730/ss_f397b912322c99dbad61bd4286517de7f7695840.1920x1080.jpg?t=1675960384,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2097730/ss_06127f0c32f7cc93a17892570536142257288c0b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1675960384,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2097730/ss_911bdc1e267c1aea5942f1459d3d985c642e4c67.1920x1080.jpg?t=1675960384,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2097730/ss_2233632dd145e41d0b918a4ba0c17f505312efcf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1675960384,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2097730/ss_905df8b642fc858580dacfacced04dd912072a2f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1675960384,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2097730/ss_ec6e6420fbf00e68ff6d16b4546c6322a36660b0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1675960384","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256926325/movie_max.mp4?t=1674757993,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256926326/movie_max.mp4?t=1674757998"

You will be managing a racing driver and a car and you will be in charge of preparing setups and strategy for the race, much like Christian Horner or Toto Wolff do in Formula 1. It will be your job to give your driver the best car, while working with your staff, but you will also have to spend your money wisely. Collect telemetry data from the races you do in order to improve your game and give yourself an advantage over your rivals next time you visit a certain track. You can also join together with your friends to form an alliance and compete in the teams championship, while working together to improve your understanding of the game. Each season in the game spans over roughly 2 months with races being simulated live two times per week (Tuesday and Friday from 20:00 CET). While the game does not require you to be online during the races to participate, watching them unfold live and chatting to fellow managers adds to the fun.

To fully awaken her powers, Irina must visit the magical springs of the island and bathe in their waters to absorb their powers. This would be little more than a vacation under normal circumstances, but Vervain is overrun by monsters summoned by the Demon Lord, who has taken residence there for some reason! Luckily for her, Legato is a former adventurer, and his company will make the pilgrimage a bit easier... Even so, it will be far from a walk in the park! In classic JRPG style, mow down hordes of monsters with your party of two, Irina and Legato. Find equipment and level them up to grow stronger to face mighty bosses. Travel across the world map to discover new locations and fight to every holy spring to gain access to new elemental spells. Enemies are visible on the map, so you can pick and choose your fights, grinding as much or as little as you wish. Spend precious mana to cast spells or charge your TP to unleash powerful innate abilities. Become the savior of Vervain Island as you complete your pilgrimage to the holy springs and unlock your true potential as a witch! Traditional JRPG Roots Fight through hordes of monsters with a duo of characters, one focused on physical and one on magical damage. Balance their healing, mana, and resources to overcome the many dungeons and bosses of the game quickly. Combat Strategy Resources are limited, but you can take advantage of the enemy's elemental weaknesses to preserve mana and HP. Irina's options will expand as the game continues, unlocking new elements and spells that will annihilate enemies that were once too difficult to tackle but be careful. Suffer too many attacks, and Irina's armor will weaken, lowering her defenses. Keep her gear in good shape to avoid taking too much damage. Packed with Laughs While Legato loves and respects Irina, he can't help being cheeky from time to time... He will see her through this pilgrimage come rain or shine, but that won't stop him from teasing her when the situation calls for it, which is quite often considering her very sheltered life.","['English', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342080/header.jpg?t=1676091613","","","info@kaguragames.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,5,0,"",0,0,"The Maiden, the Butler, and the Witch contains strong language.",0,0,0,0,"PEACH CAT","Kagura Games","Single-player,Steam Cloud","Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG","RPG,Adventure,Action,JRPG,Anime,Singleplayer,Indie,Sexual Content","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342080/ss_21d39a73aafab93a28d7782e5c8055b63db9cb34.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676091613,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342080/ss_c8c489fefc98d804c6f8f20e8824302612191cbf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676091613,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342080/ss_513125264ec9b870fc37029d03a7fb8c69257953.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676091613,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342080/ss_b7648ff949d48fe0f36087d56b4c0ab71dc766c8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676091613,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1342080/ss_4d7dd63019595156f82d4b2256a34e27c389dc4f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1676091613","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256927096/movie_max.mp4?t=1674793106"
