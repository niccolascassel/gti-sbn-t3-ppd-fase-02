Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

Features: Very beautiful graphics Classic game You can compete with your friends Supporting all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, SteamOS) A lot of Steam achievements The gameplay is very simple. When you are preparing for the match, there are some ships of different sizes - from simple battle boat to a huge battleship. You put them on the battlefield and nobody else than you knows their location. Of course, don't know the enemy's positions neither. Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety, so that the battle is always different. The game perfectly develops strategic thinking and will be useful to both adults and children.

Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting.

Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [] ▶ Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. ▶ Choose vivid colors. ▶ Take pictures under good lighting.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/header.jpg?t=1502354684","","http://www.draw-your-game.com/","contact@zerokcm.fr",True,False,False,0,"",0,18,50,"",43,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Zero One","Zero One","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support","Casual","Casual,Platformer,Hand-drawn","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_1678380950ebac84202055083b6203c8e8e0163e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_2c500bf228b7eb77b417e3a33d923ad2a808f852.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_bff6bdf44b1b291473520cc136afbca3f4d50e51.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_d94d37ed784c6f52cb31b795e2c364ed97f45851.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_9b456ef2f86761bc6b63544d272516638efbc09a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_105e22f97a7148e33bd0d6b0791547a3bb58cbed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_caf80ca9da235d21c2f9e9c606aec64a0661dfd7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_99272a04bf3261225ea88048764790614e8abd0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689941/movie_max.mp4?t=1501794251"

Keeping a house organized during quarantine can be difficult, especially when you have some remote work to do too. But don’t freak out. It's all about dividing the household chores between all family members.. When is time for one to work, is time for you to clean. But wait! In this all of a sudden hurricane of housework and remote work tasks, the only thing you can do is revisit old hobbies and find joy in the small things. Otherwise, you go insane! Let's find joy too in this frenetic shelter simulation game. All you have to do is to take great care of the house, doing all the scheduled household chores in a way that you still have some spare time. Through 10 phases with increasing levels of difficulty, sweep the floor, dust the furniture, put the trash away, do the laundry, and make sure the fridge is always full! But remember, after doing all the chores, you need to dedicate some time to the little joys available in your new routine BEFORE the clock strikes. If you don’t, you go insane, and it’s Game Over. It’s really hard to finish all the scheduled chores before the clock strikes. But between each cleared level, let’s find little pleasures in things that have passed unnoticed through your days before.
