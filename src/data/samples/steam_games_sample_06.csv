1873270,"ColdSun","Feb 9, 2022","0 - 0",0,0,0.0,0,"*** developed in 15 weeks *** Cold Sun is a powerful little narrative driven third person stealth adventure where you and your little brother attempt to sneak into the last habitable oasis in a post apocalyptic world. Created by students at UQAC, Cold Sun is a third person stealth adventure that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world that’s running out of fresh water and is overflowing with garbage (just imagine the Earth in a few decades time). The majority of the world is uninhabitable now and raiders roam the lands looking to steal everything they can from anyone passing by. There is one last habitable oasis, but getting there won’t be easy as it’s well guarded – you’ll need to bribe your way past guards and sneak past raiders as you attempt to get you and your brother to safety. It takes around 30 minutes to play through Cold Sun and it really impresses with its high quality artwork, exceptional environmental detail and heartfelt narrative. The stealth mechanics are particularly well implemented – offering a nice amount of challenge, but also being forgiving enough to allow you to recover from mistakes. A beautifully crafted little stealth adventure with a lot of heart.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1873270/header.jpg?t=1646172031","","","deosadamaslol@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,0,0,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"student games","N/A","Single-player,Full controller support","Adventure","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1873270/ss_27083ededeb26feab12a94608b8244a2bead4d40.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646172031,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1873270/ss_728dc90e496061bea14cca2c6c52f445cc1d71d4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646172031,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1873270/ss_7e052724c2c372b6864782488c6d8bf00c4b3233.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646172031,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1873270/ss_a73839c6563940f6480d71ba175ec5d4ed1bac1d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646172031,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1873270/ss_81ac33bc0df03a7e03ee90ea4b2b632ac9a5e539.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646172031","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256868658/movie_max.mp4?t=1642392570"

This visual novel is an expansive, over 800,000 word, tale that follows the coming of age story of William Aven. A young man about to chart his own course in the skies across all six nations in the Guns of Icarus universe. Journey from the frozen under-cities of Anglea, to the unforgiving sands of the Arashi desert. Dating sim? Ha! In Dust and Air you will fight ruthless air pirates, discover treasures of the ancient world, and uncover the seedy underbelly of the Guns of Icarus universe! Falling in love with the woman you love, is like icing on a cake! Each story has numerous endings and choice points which determine the outcome. Some even cross over with each other! All is Fair in Dust and Air leans more to the novel side of visual novels. We don't make you farm stat points or micromanage your relationship status. Like a good book, this visual novel is meant to be enjoyed at whatever pace you wish. This, of course includes, whatever ending you feel is best for the characters. The first story available to players will be the introduction story which takes place in Cathedral, a major independent city and trade hub within the Guns of Icarus world: Here you'll be able to experience our vision of Cathedral and meet five of our six main heroines! This initial story for Cathedral is currently over 50,000 words. Which is already surpassing most western visual novels on Steam. From here, our game production will shift to the story arcs for each heroine. These will currently be developed into standalone games that link to the original Cathedral story here. Why not DLC? Because our story arcs average close to 100,000 words each and engine constraints are a PITA! Will we revisit DLC options? Possibly! Dust and Air is a labor of love. It has been created by fans of Guns of Icarus, who were given permission by Muse Games (The creators of Guns of Icarus), to make it. From small beginnings it has since grown to the point it spawned it's own indie game studio to see it released (Broken Hammer Games). However, we must state that this is not direct canon created by Muse, nor do we have sway over Muse's canon for Guns of Icarus. Dust and Air is to be treated as a “legend,” in the universe Muse has created. It is very much a love song for the universe Muse created and we are eternally grateful for the grace they have extended to us to share it with the rest of the world. So whether you are a fan of Guns of Icarus or have never heard of it till now, we welcome you to the world that has inspired: All is Fair in Dust and Air. If you like your stay in ours, we think you'll like your stay in theirs.","['English']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1484250/header.jpg?t=1657092165","https://www.brokenhammergames.com/","https://www.brokenhammergames.com/","feedback@brokenhammergames.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,8,2,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Broken Hammer Games, LLC","Broken Hammer Games, LLC","Single-player","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Visual Novel,Romance,Dating Sim,Steampunk,Choices Matter,Anime,Story Rich,RPG,Post-apocalyptic,Hand-drawn,2D,Cute,Alternate History,Funny,Lore-Rich,Conversation,Colorful,Emotional,Fantasy,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1484250/ss_aa8a37948d20cc6441f614e10288c1c5341aee6b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657092165,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1484250/ss_4c0916cfccc1487f466cf64969a982ffc1b4a6a0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657092165,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1484250/ss_104e67b967b816dec856bc7560b0c78b94300da8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657092165,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1484250/ss_fae9b0dfed22b1a485695d4e43f1ac02e808de84.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657092165,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1484250/ss_438bd6dd170a398a946c61a6414503337a48406b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657092165","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256811958/movie_max.mp4?t=1607731235"

Play as Jacob to use his Guitar-Magic-Staff to summon Fire, Ice and Thunder or Teleport through the enemies Play as Jonah to use his Keytar-Blade to Strike and Slash through the enemy-hordes Play as Morten to use his Drumstick-Spear to fill the screen with mighty water attacks Play as Terje to use his Microphone-Hammer to create powerfull schockwaves Play as Toke to use his Guitar-Axe to burn the Evil with his Fire abilities. Move your character to the right of the screen and defeat as many enemies as you can to get Pyrapoints. If you reach the far right of a map you will transition to the next map. There are a total of 6 stages and 2 Bosses, every Stage gives you a timer of 300 seconds. You take to long? You lose! Your goal is to get the most Pyrapoints to be in the Top 10 Highscore-List.

It focuses on being distraction-free, simple, and fully customizable. Principles We built Nimble Writer with a couple principles in mind to make it stand out as a primary application for authors: Writing without distractions or worrying about formatting. Stay more organized with many useful organizational features. Materials of reference (such as photos, drawings, scribbles of text, character information, and much more) are available at your fingertips. Don't have any limitations to the default array of features. This means full customization, with a fully customizable and scriptable interface. Turn off features you don't need, change the entire look and feel of your writing environment, and much more. If you are used to writing stories in applications such as Word or other regular office tools, you'll find that Nimble Writer will be able to help you organize bundles of stories and notes together much simpler and faster. In addition, Nimble Writer is able to import some of those old documents and convert them into the Nimble Writer format. Advantages over traditional software Traditional writing software such as Word, Open Office or Google Docs are made just for the purpose of writing, so they don't have anything that helps story writers manage their notes and reference material, and neither does it offer much customization. They don't have any kind of chapter management either. Nimble Writer has all of those things, making it a much more productive choice for story writing. Steam's advantages With Nimble Writer's presence on Steam we can use the power that Steam's platform brings us, such as Steam Cloud . This means that you will be able to save your stories and notes entirely on Steam's cloud servers, so that you can load up your stories on another computer as well, just as easy! Don't forget about Steam Workshop ! With the implementation of the Workshop, you'll be able to share interface themes and addons with the world, or just to customize the app with other people's addons!

Story The Black Holes had been growing and moving toward each other for billions of years — long before life had evolved in the galaxy. The effects had been storied in lore as the blessings of the gods in the form of auroras that covered entire planets and dark omens by the strange disappearance of stars. But in the past couple of centuries, the effects of the gravitational waves (G-Waves) produced by the twin black holes had grown ever more destructive across the entire galaxy. Planets had their orbits altered to the point of making them uninhabitable, or even put on collision course with other planets. A representative from each empire in the galaxy was sent to meet on the home planet of the Phaedon Empire — an empire renown for science, prosperity, and peace. A century earlier, the very same hall had seen an end to the Great Chaos War that had engulfed the entire galaxy for nearly two centuries. Now it would host the empires as they sought a means of mutual survival as the entire galaxy is under imminent threat of destruction by foes they cannot fight. After many days of questions, ideas, and debate, the empires unanimously agreed to abandon the only galaxy they had called home and sojourn to places unknown in order that their empires may live on. It was estimated that the galaxy would be uninhabitable, if not outright destroyed, in no more than 50 years. The Phaedon had recently developed wormhole technology that would allow travel to the farthest stretches of the universe in a matter of moments. This new and untested technology would be the means by which the races would survive and live on elsewhere. The empires, united by this cause, diverted all resources to the development of the technology, scouting of the universe, and the building of the Great Arks that would transport the empires to their new foreign homes. The empires met again after new galaxies had been scouted. They debated, argued, wrangled, and finally settled on a new galaxy to reestablish their empires. An ancient Phaedon word for “hospitality” — generosity and courtesy shown to those who are far from home — was chosen as the name for their new home. It would be known as Xenia. You have been appointed leader of the Great Ark of your people. The day you have yearned for and dreaded is here as your Ark sets a heading for the wormhole. The fear and hope of your people weigh heavily on you as you consult the star charts and maps of the planets that await you on the other side. The Great Ark approaches the coordinates for staging before the launch through the wormhole, when a giant G-Wave hits your ship. Sensors detect at least another three or four in its wake. You have no choice but to launch now. The survival of the Empire and the legacy of your former galaxy are in your hands.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944640/header.jpg?t=1628989329","http://xeniasark.com/","http://www.xeniasark.com","info@maliciousgames.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,13,5,"",1,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Malicious Games","Malicious Games","Single-player","Strategy","Strategy,4X,Turn-Based,Space","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944640/ss_a9a62170895cf63d866c9b95c825ddb1fc659241.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628989329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944640/ss_70dfbf1f4d7d64f48d526888d1d0825010d2af4e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628989329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944640/ss_19a777247f72799b767c56a56af160d76738ce7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628989329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944640/ss_6a7d5dc671cd72a463087290d6cd6f78b984a119.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628989329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944640/ss_e8fd72ec5d7bbd77e1478ec0b62ff53f06c011c8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628989329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944640/ss_2761e639393b8aaa004684921c94a7c3fb7fbf3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628989329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/944640/ss_215baa92f5c1f13e0d0a752b3732dd13795a6b12.1920x1080.jpg?t=1628989329","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768033/movie_max.mp4?t=1574547910,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256730084/movie_max.mp4?t=1628513533"
467330,"Just a Cleric","May 19, 2016","0 - 20000",0,0,4.99,1,"'Just a Cleric' is my new retro-styled action RPG. Become the titular wussy cleric himself and set out to avenge your fallen comrades by attempting to do what no cleric before you has ever done: CLERIC DE COMMANDO. 'BUT DEL_DUIO!', you say, 'I CAN PLAY A QUADRILLION GAMES JUST LIKE YOURS, SO WHY SHOULD I??!!' My answer is simple: Can you play a quadrillion retro action RPGs? Of course, this isn't some weird sorta' jail! But can you play a quadrillion games like MINE? Hells no!! And here's why: =============================== JUST A CLERIC is more than the sum of its parts. =============================== To your average Joe you'll see: *Retro pixel graphics. ( Well, at least he drew his own and didn't use Realm of the Mad God's graphics! ) *Hub / town level -&gt; Missions -&gt; Get gear &amp; rewards -&gt; upgrade and buy stuff at the town -&gt; repeat game progression. ( MEH, but hey at least games like that are pretty fun. ) *4 standard stats that you can boost however you see fit. ( Oh boy, and I'll bet 3 of them suck! ) *Many (many) different types of gear to find and upgrade. Normal upgrades go to +4, and then you can bless those +4 pieces at the church in exchange for money to get the best of the best. ( Well I DO like Diablo... ) *NG+ where a better loot pool opens up, new status ailments, enemies &amp; enemy placement, and tougher bosses that gain additional abilities. That's one of the reasons why I think you NEED to beat the whole game once first as the NG+ portion holds some real challenge and of course better gear! ( New Game plus?? Adds to replay value if nothing else, hmm.. ) *A game that looks like its budget was $40. ( If that! ) But to the AWESOME and MOST-EXCELLENT observer (P.S. Skippy, this is you): *Well-written dialogue (some of the writing is smart comedy IMO, even if it isn't going to win any awards lol) I can't tell you how many times I've played some AAA title and the story is just BORING AS ALL HELL. Damn, all those millions to make a game and nobody thought to hire a real writer? With JAC, I try to take what's a simple premise and make it interesting where I can. *Different music. I love chip tunes. I love making computerized music for games and have done so lots in the past. This time though, I wanted to try something different and put my other hobby to use which is playing / writing music. So with JAC, you'll get an OST full of guitars, bass, drums, and quasi-terrible singing. (Also I don't think anybody has used a rubber ducky in their game's soundtrack before now). *A hero who's a cleric. Aside from maybe an MMORPG and the old Hexen 64 game I can't think of any game that stars a cleric exclusively. Also it was a cool thing to be able to have access to prayers that you don't normally see in any action RPG like Raise Dead. *A game that has 4 standard stats however none of them suck! I know for me I hate playing some games where your character has 8 stats and 3 or 4 of them are trash nobody ever levels up. Because I personally hate when games do this, I CHANGED THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO FRIGGIN' DO THIS. In JAC, I made a special point so that each stat is immediately useful to the player in more than one way. You're welcome! *ENCUMBRANCE MAKES A TRIUMPHANT RETURN! Haha! When I used to play the old SSI D&amp;D Goldbox games I remember that your gear load used to make you heavier and heavier and in turn you couldn't move as many squares on the battle map. Since you can't really do this in a platformer, I've come up with an interesting idea where your gear load determines how much damage you'll take from a big fall. It's equal to half of your total gear load. HUZZAH! *A funny intro and ending scene. You'll see! YOU'LL ALL SEEEEeeeeeee!!!!! (falls off a cliff) So is this the best game ever? Is this the best music ever? No, probably not.. But it's the best game ever made by a bass playin' weirdo I'll bet! P.S: And it WAS made on a budget of $40! Beat that, sweatshops of the world!!","['English']","['English']","“Just a Cleric is an enjoyable title that is actually endearing.” 3/5 – Softpedia “The dragon for the boss at the end is just crazy good-looking!” Recommended – Indie Game Review: Great Indie Games on Steam","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/header.jpg?t=1498698140","http://dxfgames.com","http://steamcommunity.com/app/467330/discussions/","dxfgames@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,31,8,"",23,0,"",0,0,0,0,"DXF Games","DXF Games","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","Action,Indie,RPG","RPG,Action,Indie,Pixel Graphics,Difficult","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_f7bcf74578cab53b0d4fd39ebe4433b6543067a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_7de7a3edacfeeaefb6965eeca4cfbc76abebeffd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_e5b7b3f00ab052a672765c09fe46c55e5a8fd9e0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_8d915db5b2597021e3cd12f2e20ee074814eb4b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_09df83d4b4b7fc0f736b1710a959c01a1f35ee53.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_bfb779091dc0ec2bf1d9cf6c9ed4a077e73b2451.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_5c48ac068e46201439fcc39af8a347ccbcf210ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_8cde5f13e3f04a20f9ad5802f5b672d066eb84ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_cc222a682f05730318c89d855e4c25e9bdac107a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_af6baa9da9a549d89e23b14895b9a9d2a89e675a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_3aa5248c3f4a396c1173844ddf1b9181c17878a3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_c17dca7bdd7d14bb79ede944200be9ebba49a6af.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_edb78a206d9b7ab5619b8a4fa178362aa7fcd038.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_0c8758581f150e6d26dcc043c71b33f27d2db4df.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_cf881564835cb4d56dfd822bd9511e5cc46909af.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_23045591b21ddce04228b92a5d892b0501462849.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_c393a2366ea59be750b1e079483422cc5bdb00f6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_e4c9f2eb4e901ccc11e3acf1308d170d94df4fff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_35ae76013e3582d2dff6fb8067c7eaa5cb7c7dcc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_d53eb1fc2802ff939f0b0651a7d0ae415a5d4e7e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/467330/ss_462017451c7830bae233cba49c23f4803b712f7e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1498698140","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256663928/movie_max.mp4?t=1463004326,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256663929/movie_max.mp4?t=1463689854,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256664044/movie_max.mp4?t=1463004337"
